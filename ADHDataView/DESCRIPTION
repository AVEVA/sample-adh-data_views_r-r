Description: This package is a very simple client library that connects
    to AVEVA Data Hub (ADH) with client credentials, then returns
    data from a data view. This is intended to be the bare minimum to demo
    the creation of an R data frame from ADH data and is not intended to be
    an exhaustive example of ADH capabilities.
