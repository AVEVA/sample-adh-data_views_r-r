Author: OSIsoft LLC
Maintainer: OSISoft Samples <samples@osisoft.com>
Description: This package is a very simple client library that connects
    to OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) with client credentials, then returns
    data from a data view. This is intended to be the bare minimum to demo
    the creation of an R data frame from OCS data and is not intended to be
    an exhaustive example of OCS capabilities.
